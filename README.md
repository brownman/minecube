# minecube

## Disclaimer

Minecube is merely a code name, it will be changed. Don't whine that it's too close to another particular cube-related game. Minecube is in no way affilliated with any other game, or any company. Including a particular one with a very similar name.

The name *will* be changed later, to avoid issues. We're just waiting until it's worth making a name for.

## Installation

### Software needed for compiling

#### *NIX

For *NIX, specifically on Linux distributions, the developers don't have a recommended IDE.

* git (optional, but recommended)
* C++ compiler (clang++ and g++ have been tested on *nix)
* GNU make
* OpenGL and headers
* SFML and headers

#### Windows

For Windows, the developers are currently using Visual Studio. We will work on a makefile or similar.

* git (optional, but recommended)
* C++ compiler (MSVC?)
* OpenGL SDK (binaries are included, but are the headers?)
* SFML SDK

## Where to get software

All of these, except MSVC, should be available in your package manager, if you have one. The links provided are only needed if you are using a platform without a package manager, i.e. Windows.

* git: [http://git-scm.com/download](http://git-scm.com/download)
* g++: [http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/](http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/)
* MSVC: Purchase Visual Studio or grab an [Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP)
* GNU make: [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* OpenGL: Supposed to be provided on Windows and OS X by default. Other platforms: check your package manager if you don't have it already.
* SFML: [http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

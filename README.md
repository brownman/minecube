# minecube

## Disclaimer

Minecube is merely a code name, it will be changed. Don't whine that it's too close to another particular cube-related game.
Minecube is in no way affilliated with any other game, or any company. Including a particular one with a very similar name.


The name *will* be changed later, to avoid issues. We're just waiting until it's worth making a name for.

## Installation

### Software needed for compiling

#### *NIX

For *NIX, specifically on Linux distributions, the developers don't have a recommended IDE.

* git (optional, but recommended)
* C++ compiler (only g++ has been tested on *nix)
* GNU make
* OpenGL
* SFML

#### Windows

For Windows, the developers are currently using Visual Studio. We will work on a makefile or similar.

* git (optional, but recommended)
* C++ compiler (MSVC)
* OpenGL
* SFML

## Where to get software

All of these should be available in package managers, if you have one.
We are providing links for Windows users and other systems without package managers.

* git: package manager, or [http://git-scm.com/download](http://git-scm.com/download)
* g++: [http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/](http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/)
* MSVC: ?
* GNU make: [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* OpenGL: Supposed to be provided on Windows and OS X by default. Other systems: check your package manager if you don't have it already.
* SFML: [http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
